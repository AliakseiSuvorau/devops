# Lab 2. Docker app with db

---
Run this line from the project root to run the app:

```bash
docker-compose -f .\docker\docker-compose.yml up
```

As a result, both containers will be started successfully (all the data is already hardcoded, which is a bad example, but for a lab it will have to do)

At the end of deployment we will see the following text reporting a successful build:
```
backend   | User was created
backend   | 
backend   | BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 11s
```
